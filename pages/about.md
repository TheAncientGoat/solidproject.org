# About Solid

Solid lets you bring your data together into a decentralized data 
store called a Pod. It is like a personal Web server for your data.

* You control the data in your Pod. 
* It is all stored
and accessed using standard, open, and interoperable data formats and protocols.
* Any kind of information can be stored
in a Solid Pod. 
* You can share slices of your data with the people, organizations, 
and applications you choose, and you can revoke that access at any time.

Because everything is interoperable, different applications can
read and write the same data, instead of creating new data silos that make 
your data difficult to use in its entirety.

Consequently, you can do more with your data, because the applications 
you decide to use can be granted access to a wider and more diverse 
set of information. This lets them give you more value, without 
forcing you to relinquish control of what's yours.

## How does Solid work?

A Solid Server hosts one or more Solid Pods, accessible via the
[Solid Protocol](https://solid.github.io/specification/#protocol).

A Pod hosted on a Solid Server is fully compartmentalized from 
any others. It has its own set of data and access rules, and is
fully controlled by whoever it belongs to (i.e. you).

You decide where to host your Pod. You can opt to have it hosted for
you by an expanding network of 
[Pod Providers](/users/get-a-pod), or you can 
[host it yourself](/self-hosting/).

You can also have more than one Pod, hosted in different places. This is 
effectively transparent to the applications and services you use, because
your data, wherever it is hosted, or data that has been shared with you, 
is all linked through your 
[Identity](https://solid.github.io/specification/#identity).

You can store any kind of data in a Solid Pod, and you can
determine who or what can access that data at a granular level,
using Solid's 
[Authentication](https://solid.github.io/specification/#authentication) and 
[Authorization](https://solid.github.io/specification/#authorization) systems.

The linked data model makes the data you store 
interoperable by using open, standard formats, that can be validated by 
the Solid Server to ensure data isn't corrupted by disparate applications.

This means that you can share select portions of your data with other 
people and groups you trust, or with an emerging ecosystem of 
applications and services, that can read and write data in your Pod using
standard patterns for application interoperability. And just as you
can share your data with others, they can also share their data with you. 
This creates rich and collaborative experiences across a combination of
both personal and shared data.
